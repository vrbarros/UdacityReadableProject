# Udacity React Readable Projeto

This is the second project from React Udacity course and part of the learning process of React by me.

The main purporse of this project is develop an React application that uses React + Router and Redux.

This project is for the final assessment project for Udacity's Redux course where you will build a content and comment web app. Users will be able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users will also be able to edit and delete posts and comments.

This repository includes the code for the backend API Server that you'll use to develop and interact with the front-end portion of the project.

## How to Use

To get started using this application follow this procedure:

* Install and start the API server
    - `cd api-server`
    - `npm install`
    - `node server`
* In another terminal window, choose front-end directory
    - `cd frontend`
    - `npm install`
    - `npm start`

## API Server

Information about the API server and how to use it can be found in its [README file](api-server/README.md).
